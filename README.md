# React Hooks ðŸŽ£

This is a simple demo / sandbox to show and test the use of React hooks.

To test one of these examples, just set the componenet displayed in the <App /> component of App.js.

### useRef Example 1, 2, and 3
**Example 1**: Shows simple use of refs to get and set parameters of react components between renders.
**Example 2**: useRef being used to save previous states
**Example 3**: useRef used to assure that react element becomes unmounted after async operation

### useMemo Example
This example showed how expensive functions can be bipassed with useMemo. This way, only runs if it's inputs change from last render to the current one.

### Custom Hooks
Custom hooks folder, which has a hook for **useFetch** and **useLocalStorage**.
_These are very common custom hooks. Good Snippets to keep_
